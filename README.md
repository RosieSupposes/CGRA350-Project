# CGRA Project

This is a group project from my third year course, CGRA350. Each group member was tasked with finding a research paper to emulate and then we integrated them together. 
The project is built in C++ with the OpenGL library. I transferred this project from our university's Gitlab server so the commit history may look odd. 

My contribution to this project was the firefly swarm, and my code can be found in the "firefly" folder. I followed "SIGGRAPH Conference Paper (JiMing Ma, Hao Yang Chen, RiJian Su, Yan Wang, Song Zhang, ShiJiao Shan, “Improved Firefly Algorithm and Its Application”, 2019)" as the inspiration for the swarm movement the fireflies follow. And "SIGGRAPH Conference Paper (Saty Raghavachary, “Firefly flash synchronization”, 2003)" as the inspiration for the flashing sequence the fireflies use.
